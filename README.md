# JavaScript DOM append strategies

## Purpose
Demonstration of three strategies for appending several elements to the DOM:
1. One append per element
2. Creating the elements in memory and appending only once
3. Writing the elements in a template literal and adding it to the parent's `innerHTML`

Check the console in the browser developer tools for the time each approach takes.

## Tools
JavaScript / HTML5
